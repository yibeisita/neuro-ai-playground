## Project 01 — EEG/MEGG Aalysis

A step-by-step Jupyter notebook series for learning how to process, visualize, and analyze EEG and MEG data using MNE-Python. This repository follows the official MNE tutorials and provides a beginner-friendly workflow from raw data inspection to time-frequency analysis.

### Background

EEG (Electroencephalography) and MEG (Magnetoencephalography) are non-invasive neuroimaging techniques used to measure brain activity.  

- **EEG** measures electrical potentials generated by neurons, recorded via electrodes placed on the scalp.  
- **MEG** measures the magnetic fields produced by neuronal currents, recorded using highly sensitive magnetometers.  

These techniques are widely used in neuroscience and clinical research to study:  
- Brain rhythms and oscillations (alpha, beta, gamma waves)  
- Sensory processing and cognitive functions  
- Event-related potentials (ERPs) and fields (ERFs)  
- Brain disorders such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and cognitive impairments  

This project provides a hands-on introduction to EEG/MEG data analysis, from raw data handling to time-frequency analysis, allowing beginners to understand both the computational and neuroscientific aspects.

## Getting Started

**Run the notebooks** in order:

   * `01_load_and_inspect_data.ipynb` – Load raw EEG/MEG data and inspect channels
   * `02_preprocessing_and_filtering.ipynb` – Filter and clean data
   * `03_epoching_and_events.ipynb` – Extract epochs and analyze event-related responses
   * `04_time_frequency_analysis.ipynb` – Visualize how spectral content changes over time
   * `05_source_localization.ipynb` (optional) – Source modeling


The main goals of this project are:  

1. **Learn to handle EEG/MEG data**: Understand how raw recordings are structured, including channels, sampling frequency, and events.  
2. **Preprocess data effectively**: Apply filters, remove artifacts, and select relevant channels.  
3. **Analyze event-related activity**: Extract epochs and compute averaged responses (ERPs/ERFs).  
4. **Explore frequency content**: Visualize power spectral densities and time-frequency dynamics.  
5. **Build a reproducible workflow**: Organize notebooks, results, and data in a way suitable for learning and sharing.  

By completing this project, beginners gain practical experience using **MNE-Python** and a conceptual understanding of EEG/MEG analysis.
