## Project 01 — EEG/MEGG Aalysis

A step-by-step Jupyter notebook series for learning how to process, visualize, and analyze EEG and MEG data using MNE-Python. This repository follows the official MNE tutorials and provides a beginner-friendly workflow from raw data inspection to time-frequency analysis.

### Background

EEG (Electroencephalography) and MEG (Magnetoencephalography) are non-invasive neuroimaging techniques used to measure brain activity.  

- **EEG** measures electrical potentials generated by neurons, recorded via electrodes placed on the scalp.  
- **MEG** measures the magnetic fields produced by neuronal currents, recorded using highly sensitive magnetometers.  

These techniques are widely used in neuroscience and clinical research to study:  
- Brain rhythms and oscillations (alpha, beta, gamma waves)  
- Sensory processing and cognitive functions  
- Event-related potentials (ERPs) and fields (ERFs)  
- Neurological and psychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and cognitive decline

This project introduces the fundamental workflow for EEG/MEG analysis, emphasizing data loading, inspection, visualization, and basic preprocessing using real data from the official MNE sample dataset.

## Getting Started

**Run the notebooks** in order:

| Notebook                               | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `01_load_and_inspect_data.ipynb`       | Load raw EEG/MEG data and inspect metadata, channels, and power spectra.      |
| `02_preprocessing_and_filtering.ipynb` | Filter the data, identify noisy or flat channels, and perform basic cleaning. |
| `03_epoching_and_evoked.ipynb`         | Detect events, extract epochs, and compute simple event-related responses.    |

Project Goals: 

1. **Understand EEG/MEG data structure**: Learn about channels, sampling frequency, metadata, and event markers in raw recordings.

2. **Visualize raw data**: Plot and explore EEG/MEG signals, channel types, and spectral characteristics.

3. **Preprocess data**: Apply filtering, identify noisy channels, and prepare clean signals for further analysis.

4. **Detect and visualize events**: Extract experimental events (e.g., auditory or visual stimuli) from the data and prepare them for epoching and event-related analysis.
